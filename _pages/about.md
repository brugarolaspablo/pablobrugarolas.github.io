I am a last-year PhD candidate in Economics working under the supervision of [Sara Ayll√≥n](http://www.saraayllon.eu/)
(University of Girona & IZA). I am part of the [Women in Social and Public Policy Research Hub](https://www.lse.ac.uk/social-policy/research/Research-clusters/WISPPRH) at LSE. 

During the next academic year, I will be visiting University of La Laguna's Department of Economics as a Visiting PhD Student, where I will have the opportunity to work with [Gustavo Marrero](https://portalciencia.ull.es/investigadores/82381/detalle?lang=en).

I am passionately engaged in `family economics`, `economics of human development`, `education economics`, `economics of poverty and inequality`, and `causal-inference methods`. My thesis delves into the impacts of universal childcare policies on children and mothers, combining meta-analysis with causal designs.
