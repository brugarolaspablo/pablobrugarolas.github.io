I am a second-year PhD candidate in Economics working under the supervision of [Sara Ayllón](http://www.saraayllon.eu/)
(University of Girona & IZA).

In January 2024, I will be joining LSE's Department of Social Policy as a Visiting PhD Research Student,  where I will have the opportunity to work with
[Almudena Sevilla](https://www.lse.ac.uk/social-policy/people/academic-staff/Professor-Almudena-Sevilla) (LSE & IZA).

I am passionately engaged in `family economics`, `economics of human development`, `education economics`, `economics of poverty and inequality`, and `causal-inference methods`. My thesis delves into the impacts of universal childcare policies. The first chapter uses modern meta-analysis techniques to analyze whether causal estimates of the impact of enrolling into universal childcare programs on children’s development are affected by publication bias. In the second chapter, I explore the effects of income-adjusted childcare fees on immigrant children's enrollment in Catalonia, leveraging a staggered event study design. The third chapter assesses the long-term developmental returns of Barcelona's public childcare expansion, using a recent difference-in-differences design for continuous treatments to compare health, education, and labor market achievements across children cohorts and districts.
